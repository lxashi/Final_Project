# Models Folder

This folder contains pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for use in our final project. Instead of retraining these models from scratch, you can load them directly from this folder.

# Contents

* TemperatureForecastingModelMonthly_CNN.h5 : This file contains the pre-trained CNN model weights for Monthly Data.
* TemperatureForecastingModelMonthly_LSTM.h5: This file contains the pre-trained LSTM model weights for Monthly Data.
* TemperatureForecastingModelYearly_CNN.h5 : This file contains the pre-trained CNN model weights for Yearly Data.
* TemperatureForecastingModelYearly_LSTM.h5: This file contains the pre-trained LSTM model weights for Yearly Data.


# Usage
You can easily load these pre-trained models as specified within the Notebook.
