# CM3070 Final project

## Project Title: United Kingdom's Climate Change Analysis And Surface Temperature Forecasting

## - Project Overview

* This project idea falls under the course "CM3015 Machine Learning and Neural Networks" and itâ€™s based on the Project Idea Title 1: Deep Learning on a Public Dataset. It aims to analyze UK surface temperature data and create predictive models for future temperature changes using various machine and deep learning models. It uses the "Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data" from Kaggle, which provides global historical temperature records, making it suitable for studying temperature patterns and building predictive models.

## - Objective
* Conduct a comprehensive analysis of historical temperature data for the United Kingdom to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in surface temperatures. This includes exploring variations over different time scales, such as monthly and yearly patterns.
* Develop and evaluate predictive models that can forecast future temperature variations for the United Kingdom. Utilize a range of forecasting techniques, including traditional time series models like ARIMA and advanced machine learning models like neural networks, to achieve accurate predictions.


## - Dataset Description

* The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country or By state). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they apply. They also use methods that allow weather observations from shorter time series to be included, meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away.
* Make sure to Download the full dataset from the attached Source, as not the all files was apploaded to this repo.

## - Challenges  

* **Understanding Climate Data and Time Series** : Understanding climate data and time series involves analyzing historical temperature records, detecting patterns, and addressing climate-related questions. It requires knowledge of data analysis and time series to gain insights into climate dynamics.

* **Building Time Series Predictive Models** : Building predictive models for time series data is a challenging task, involving model selection, parameter tuning, and handling time-dependent information. It requires advanced modelling techniques for applications like climate forecasting and stock price prediction.

## - Conclusion & Findings 

In summary, this project thoroughly assesses various forecasting models for temperature prediction in the UK. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of models like SARIMA and CNN for monthly data, and ARIMA for yearly predictions. This research emphasizes the importance of aligning models with data characteristics. It also showcases the benefits of using a diverse set of models and sheds light on optimizing neural networks like CNN and LSTM for better predictions. This knowledge can serve as a valuable resource for climate analysis and decision-making in climate change strategies.


## - Key Takeaways

* **Effective Model Selection:** We carefully compared various forecasting models, from basic regressions to advanced time series models. By evaluating their performance on monthly and yearly temperature data, we identified the top-performing models. This empowers us to choose the most suitable models for accurate temperature forecasting.

* **Data Quality Matters:** Thorough data analysis and preprocessing were essential. We conducted in-depth exploratory analysis, addressed missing data, checked for stationarity, and uncovered seasonal and autocorrelation patterns. These steps enhanced data quality, reduced bias, and ultimately improved the precision of our forecasting models.
